# Michael Wei's CV Repository

This repository contains the source for my CV.

If you are looking for the my CV built from these sources, you can find it [here](http://wei.systems/cv).

It is based on https://github.com/JesperDramsch/latex-cv-boosted. It contains a lot of modifications 
and is not really usable for public consumption (for instance, a lot of hard-coded modifications
and data in the .cls file), but feel free to use it if you find any part of it useful.
